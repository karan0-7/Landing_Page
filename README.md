# Landing_Page

Hello

The video for the link is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o1ACcv02tUVdqdOjA1n_JGowQ95sXB33/view?usp=drive_link

There was no use for React states to be used as this is a static page.
There were no CRUD operations involved as there was no sending/receiving of data during the entire process.


All requirments of the task have been met. 
If there is a chance of improvement, then the changes too can be performed.

Thank you for your time.
